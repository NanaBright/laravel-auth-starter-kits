# Security Policy

üîí **Security is our top priority.** We take all security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your help in keeping Laravel Auth Starter Kits secure.

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them responsibly by:

### üìß Email Reporting
Send an email to: **security@laravel-auth-starter-kits.com**

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, XSS)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### üîê Encrypted Reporting
For sensitive security issues, you can encrypt your report using our PGP key:

```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP Key would be included here in a real implementation]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

## ‚ö° Response Timeline

We will acknowledge your email within **24 hours** and provide a detailed response within **72 hours** indicating:
- Confirmation of the issue
- Timeline for fixes
- Any workarounds available
- Credit preferences
