## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. Please help us keep our users safe by responsibly disclosing any security issues you find.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please send an email to: **security@yourproject.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### What to Expect

- **Response Time**: We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 7 days

### Disclosure Process

1. **Report received** - We acknowledge the report
2. **Validation** - We confirm and assess the vulnerability
3. **Fix development** - We develop and test a fix
4. **Coordinated disclosure** - We work with you on disclosure timing
5. **Public disclosure** - We release the fix and public advisory

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **OTP-based authentication** with time-limited codes
- **Rate limiting** on SMS sending and verification attempts
- **Laravel Sanctum** for secure API token management
- **CSRF protection** on all forms
- **Input validation** and sanitization

### Data Protection

- **Password hashing** using Laravel's bcrypt
- **Phone number validation** and normalization
- **Secure session handling** with configurable options
- **Database prepared statements** preventing SQL injection
- **XSS protection** via Laravel's built-in mechanisms

### SMS Security

- **Rate limiting** prevents SMS spam and abuse
- **OTP expiration** limits exposure window
- **Phone number verification** ensures accurate delivery
- **Logging controls** for sensitive information
- **Multiple delivery methods** for redundancy

### Infrastructure Security

- **HTTPS enforcement** in production
- **Secure headers** configuration
- **Environment variable** protection
- **Error handling** without information disclosure
- **File upload restrictions** (if applicable)

## Security Configuration

### Production Security Settings

```env
# Environment
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false

# Sessions
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
SESSION_SAME_SITE=strict

# HTTPS
FORCE_HTTPS=true

# Rate Limiting
SMS_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
```

### Recommended Security Headers

```php
// Add to middleware or web server config
'Strict-Transport-Security' => 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
'X-Content-Type-Options' => 'nosniff',
'X-Frame-Options' => 'DENY',
'X-XSS-Protection' => '1; mode=block',
'Referrer-Policy' => 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
'Content-Security-Policy' => "default-src 'self'",
```

### Database Security

```sql
-- Use least privilege principle
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON phone_auth.* TO 'sms_auth'@'localhost';

-- Regular security updates
UPDATE mysql.user SET plugin = 'mysql_native_password' WHERE User = 'sms_auth';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## Vulnerability Categories

### High Severity

- Authentication bypass
- SQL injection
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation
- Data exposure

### Medium Severity

- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Information disclosure
- Rate limit bypass

### Low Severity

- Denial of service
- Information leakage
- Minor configuration issues

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Keep dependencies updated**
   ```bash
   composer audit
   npm audit
   ```

2. **Use secure coding practices**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Follow OWASP guidelines

3. **Regular security testing**
   - Static code analysis
   - Dependency scanning
   - Penetration testing

### For Operators

1. **Server hardening**
   - Keep OS and software updated
   - Configure firewalls
   - Use intrusion detection
   - Monitor logs

2. **Database security**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Enable encryption at rest
   - Regular backups
   - Access controls

3. **Monitoring and logging**
   - Monitor failed login attempts
   - Track SMS sending patterns
   - Set up alerting for anomalies
   - Regular log review
